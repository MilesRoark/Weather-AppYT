This was done shadow coding the youtube channel GreatStack
In this tutorial we used fetch to get data from an API
The data is weather information from openweathermap.org
I added the functionality to get the info by pressing enter using the keydown eventlistener.
I also added an @media to make it mobile responsive up to 375 px.
