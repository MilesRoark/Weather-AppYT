This was done shadow coding the YouTube channel GreatStack
In this tutorial, we used fetch to get data from an API
The data is weather information from openweathermap.org
I added the functionality to get the info by pressing enter using the keydown event listener.
I also added an @media to make it mobile responsive up to 375 px.
The style2 and script2  files are refactored versions that I got when I asked ChatGPT to look through my code and make it better.
